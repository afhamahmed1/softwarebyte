                        Open-source Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) framework Laravel is built on the MVC architecture. Developers of the popular Laravel framework have access to a wealth of tools and resources that allow them to create sophisticated web applications in record time. Professionals that use the Laravel Framework often host events and keep their apps in good working order. When it comes to web application frameworks, Laravel stands out for its clean, well-structured syntax. We think growth should be stimulating and novel to be enjoyable. In terms of benefits, Laravel's ability to simplify web development is unparalleled. It makes working on online projects easier for persons who have atypical duties. Concerns around authentication, caching, routing, and session lifetimes all fall under this category.

                        The fact that PHP is supported by the Laravel framework contributes to its popularity. It's probably no secret that PHP is the mandated language of choice for developing anything related to the web. Since PHP is used by about 78.9% of all websites, the answer seems obvious.
